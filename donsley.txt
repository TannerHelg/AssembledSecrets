A cold wind pushes through the room, as the door swings open.
Tattered leather shoes carry a young man, soot and coal stains covering his thin body.

"heya, m'name is Donsley..."

"I'm real sorry to hear what happened sir, but I don't know nothin' 'bout this murder"
He shifts his feet awkwardly in his chair, dropping eye contact as he answers the question

        ^
        He is not a good liar, but the man in front of you is too much of a coward to mislead about murder.
        Maybe he is covering for some other crime.

        While there might be more than meets the eye, you have a hard time thinking that a man of his build could take out the victim.
        Either Donsley is innocent, or he had some ulterior plans

"I wish I could help more I do..."

"T-that was last night, right?"
His hands cross, as he begins to nervously fidget in his chair
"Well.. I was at me home, all the way over on 8th and Main sir"

        <
        8th and Main would be a 20 minute drive, or two hour walk, not impossible, but definitely not nearby.

        Not the wealthiest neighborhood, full of smaller low-income houses. He'd fit in perfectly if he's telling the truth

"Well...um..." He shifts uncomfortably in his seat, trying to move away from the question.
His eyes try to find an answer somewhere in the ceiling tiles.
"We did business... and um..." he stammers on.

        >
        As he trails over his memories, he scratches against his shirt collar.
        These memories seem to have reminded him of how uncomfortable he is.

        It's rather obvious what he means by this, the victim used to deal drugs either to or from him.
        |
He looks back at you, waiting for you to move on.

"Oh work! I work in the coal mines here on the edge o' town", he pats a smoke of soot from his clothes out into the room.

        <
        The coal processing plant is only a few blocks away from where the victim was found, Donsley here would've been close at least during his shift.

"It is good word, hard work, but good work."
        ^
        The work is not enjoyable, nor does it pay well, yet he shows some genuine pride in being an employee nonetheless.

"Oh no sir, my real name be Donald, but erry'body always has called me this, ever since I was little."

        It isn't the kind of nickname one gives themself, it is a nickname he is stuck with, not necessarily one he wants
        |

        He has no muscle mass, and when he was younger he also didn't. There would be few people he could 'convince' to stop calling him it.
